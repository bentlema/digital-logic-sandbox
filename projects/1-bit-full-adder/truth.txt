We want to add 2 x 1-bit numbers:

C1 = Carry_IN
C2 = Carry_OUT

     C1
      A     <-- 1-bit number A
  +   B     <-- 1-bit number B
 -------
   C2 S     <-- Sum of number A and B


Truth Table:

 C1  B   A  |  C2  S
--- --- --- | --- ---
 0   0   0  |  0   0
 0   0   1  |  0   1
 0   1   0  |  0   1
 0   1   1  |  1   0
 1   0   0  |  0   1
 1   0   1  |  1   0
 1   1   0  |  1   0
 1   1   1  |  1   1
